"""
Splits a FASTA file of DNA into pieces for array orders

***REQUIRED***

- Run with contig and step size as 76
- TAG at head of dna is format $ _ _ # _ _ _
  meaning 7 characters, so 28 DNA bases
- To ensure mod 4, pad the ends of the DNA with 2 bases (106 --> 104, padded with AA at the end)
- 104-28 = 76 for the chunk size
- stuffer sequence is TGAC, corresponding to single quote '

Steps to replicate:
$ python arraychunker.py outfile.txt 76 76 TGAC
$ python
>>> import os
>>> infile = open("outfile.txt","r")
>>> newfile = open("new.txt","w")
>>> for line in infile:
...     newfile.write("%s\n" % line[2:])    # to account for correct reading frame since adaptor is 22 bp
...	newfile.flush()
...	os.fsync(newfile.fileno())
>>>	infile.close()
>>>	newfile.close()
$ ls
$ python
>>> from ASCIIcodons import *
>>> o = DNAToText()
>>> o.translate("new.txt","trans.txt")
